        <p class="bold">Tunnel Transformation – Urban Activation in Schaerbeek</p>
        <p class="italic">Group project with Marwane Zinebioui and Helena Lauwreys</p><br>
        <p>This project was developed together with Marwane Zinebioui and Helena Lauwreys. It started with a collaborative mapping exercise aimed at understanding the neighbourhood of Schaerbeek in Brussels. By analysing the area’s spatial, social and infrastructural characteristics, we were able to identify its needs and latent potentials.<br>
        <br>
        In the second phase, we each focused individually on a specific site. I chose the tunnel near Pieux Vibro, close to the former brewery on Paviljoenstraat. Based on the urban research we conducted in the previous weeks, I developed the idea of reclaiming and activating this neglected space. Rather than treating the tunnel as mere infrastructure, I proposed a radical reinterpretation of its use.<br>
        <br>
        The ambition was to design a space that would animate the adjacent square 24/7, not only during the day, but also at night. This marked the beginning of my architectural exploration into nightlife culture and spatial activation through club design. It was my very first experiment in merging my passion for nightclubs with architecture.<br>
        <br>
        The tunnel was reimagined as a space of dual function. One side was dedicated to mobility, with an improved and more inviting bicycle route that concluded in a small, integrated bike repair shop. The other half was an immersive spatial experience inspired by Alice in Wonderland. Visitors would be drawn in by a wide, inviting entrance, almost like a rabbit hole, which then transitioned into a sequence of narrow passages, evoking a sense of mystery and curiosity. At the end of this journey, a hidden dancefloor revealed itself, a surreal, unexpected “new world” tucked beneath the city.<br>
        <br>
        This project was not only about urban transformation, but also about exploring how architecture can create moments of escape, intrigue and social connection within the everyday fabric of the city.</p>
