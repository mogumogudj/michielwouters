        <p>Reflective text on the early years of my bachelor’s studies at KU Leuven<br>
        In the early semesters of my bachelor’s program, I struggled to find my own architectural style. This was expected since my previous schooling didn’t emphasize the arts. Suddenly, I had to express myself visually, especially in classes like Expressie, which focused on personal artistic growth. This challenge felt unfamiliar and overwhelming. In our design studios, I experimented with every medium I could think of, from hand-drawn sketches and clay sculptures to digital collages and computer-generated images.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This exploration was important, but it was not easy. I often felt confused, unsure of what worked for me or how to put my ideas into form. There wasn’t any clear direction. All I had was a desire to try, fail, and try again. Eventually, I started to favor digital tools. One of the first technical drawings I created was in AutoCAD for an elective course I selected on my own. It felt like progress, but I soon realized that AutoCAD, especially its 3D interface, didn’t fit my intuitive way of working. It seemed rigid and restrictive.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That discovery drove me to look for other software, and that’s when I found Rhino. Its flexibility and accuracy let me design more freely and visually, aligning with my thought process. Gradually, I began to feel more in control. The software became not just a tool but an extension of my design thinking. Learning Rhino marked a key moment for me; it gave me the confidence to build my own workflow and aesthetic language, grounded in digital drawing and modeling.</p>
