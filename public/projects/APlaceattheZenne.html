        <p class="bold">A Place at the Zenne – Adaptive Reuse Along the River</p>
        <p class="italic">Bachelor thesis project under the guidance of Wes Degreef</p><br>
        <p>This project, titled A Place at the Zenne, was my bachelor thesis, guided by architect and tutor Wes Degreef. The assignment asked us to design a socially engaged intervention that also included a dwelling for someone actively using the space.<br>
        <br>
        My approach was based on minimal intervention. I aimed to create a design that was as economically efficient as possible while still having a meaningful spatial and social impact. Rather than adding new structures, I focused on connecting and reactivating a series of vacant brick buildings located along the Zenne river.<br>
        <br>
        Through a few targeted architectural moves, I established new links between these buildings, creating a cohesive whole. The existing bricks were repurposed to construct large parts of the new dwelling, while also helping to forge stronger material and visual connections with the surrounding context.<br>
        <br>
        These newly introduced pathways not only served as circulation routes but also became places for encounter and exchange. They stitched the buildings together into a shared fabric of movement and interaction.<br>
        <br>
        Each part of the site was reprogrammed to host specific social functions. One space became an open kitchen for young chefs, another was turned into a learning and making hub. In this way, the project offered a layered response to both spatial vacancy and community needs by using architecture as a catalyst for regeneration through simplicity and care.</p>
